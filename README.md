Did you look at this:

![games.on.net Forums with tall header](/goosmurf/games-on-net-cleanup/raw/master/images/promo_small.png)

And have this reaction:

I tried to keep it simple so as not to mess with the styles etc.  I don't
intend on making too many changes to this.  If you make any nifty
modifications please submit a pull request.
